Logging tools differ significantly in their **flexibility**, **intrusiveness**, **reentrancy**, **resource usage**, suitability for **bare-metal** and/or **RTOS-based systems**, **cost**, and more. Many of these tools are primarily designed for event logging, making them less suitable for general embedded system data logging. Additionally, they are often only partially configurable.

Many `printf-like` logging solutions offload data decoding to a host system instead of performing it directly on the embedded device. This approach often requires transferring the printf-like strings to the host, which increases the demand on the data-logging buffer and can slow down the logging process. Additionally, many logging functions are not reentrant or they require a significant amount of stack space. Some solutions also use inefficient data encoding, which further contributes to the need for larger data-logging buffers.

The list includes tools that are not full-fledged logging solutions but can assist with the implementation of logging or testing of embedded systems.

**Use a solution that meets your requirements.** Some solutions are more optimal but require a bit more learning. This initial effort is often worthwhile, as the same solution can be applied to a large number of projects.
