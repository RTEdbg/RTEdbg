Most of these tools are primarily designed for event logging, making them less suitable for general embedded system data logging. Additionally, they are often only partially configurable. Many toolkits offload printf-like data decoding to the host system rather than performing it directly within the embedded system. However, in most cases, the printf-like strings need to be transferred to the host, which increases the demand on the data-logging buffer and slows down the logging process. Furthermore, many logging functions require significant stack space. Some solutions also employ inefficient data encoding, leading to the need for larger data-logging buffers. Most of these tools offer only basic print-style formatting support.
